# ðŸš€ Deployment Readiness Checklist

This checklist ensures your MetaReverse Health App is ready for production deployment.

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Validation

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] All required environment variables are set (check `.env.example`)
- [ ] Supabase integration is connected in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Blob storage integration is connected in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] AI API keys are configured (DeepSeek and/or Google Gemini)
- [ ] Environment health check passes: `/api/health/env`

### 2. Database Setup
- [ ] Supabase project is created and configured
- [ ] Database tables are created (run SQL scripts if needed)
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled
- [ ] Service role key has proper permissions

### 3. TypeScript & Build Validation
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in codebase
- [ ] All imports use proper `@/` path aliases
- [ ] Component prop types are correct (especially Icon3D components)
- [ ] AI SDK integration uses correct prop names (`maxOutputTokens`, not `maxTokens`)
- [ ] Database queries use proper error handling (`.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()`)

### 4. Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [ ] Environment variables are properly scoped (public vs private)
- [ ] `.env*` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies protect user data
- [ ] Service role key is only used server-side

### 5. Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Images are optimized and use proper Next.js Image component
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable (check with `ANALYZE=true npm run build`)
- [ ] Error boundaries are in place for critical components
- [ ] Loading states are implemented for async operations

## ðŸ”§ Quick Validation Commands

Run these commands to validate your setup:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Type check
npm run type-check

# 3. Build test (most important)
npm run build

# 4. Test environment configuration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/env

# 5. Test database connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/database

# 6. Test Supabase connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/supabase
\`\`\`

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures

**TypeScript Errors:**
- Check Icon3D components use `shape` prop (not `type`)
- Ensure size props use valid values: "sm", "md", "lg", "xl" (not "xs")
- Verify AI SDK uses `maxOutputTokens` (not `maxTokens`)

**Import Errors:**
- All imports should use `@/` alias
- Check `tsconfig.json` path mapping is correct
- Verify all imported files exist

**Environment Variable Errors:**
- Check `.env.local` file exists and has all required variables
- Verify Vercel integrations are properly connected
- Use environment health check endpoint

### Database Issues

**Connection Failures:**
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check database is accessible from your deployment region
- Ensure connection pooling is properly configured

**Query Errors:**
- Use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()` for optional data
- Add proper error handling for all database operations
- Check RLS policies allow necessary operations

### AI Integration Issues

**API Key Problems:**
- Verify at least one AI provider key is configured
- Check API key validity and quotas
- Ensure proper fallback between DeepSeek and Gemini

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Deployment
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or push to main branch if auto-deployment is enabled
git push origin main
\`\`\`

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Database operations function correctly
- [ ] AI features are responsive
- [ ] File uploads work (if using Blob storage)
- [ ] All integrations are functional

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Vercel Analytics is enabled
- [ ] Error tracking is configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring is active
- [ ] Database monitoring is set up

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

1. âœ… Build completes without errors
2. âœ… All environment variables are configured
3. âœ… Database connections are stable
4. âœ… Authentication works end-to-end
5. âœ… AI features respond correctly
6. âœ… File uploads function (if applicable)
7. âœ… No console errors on page load
8. âœ… Core user flows work as expected

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** in project settings
3. **Test locally** with production environment variables
4. **Check integration status** in Vercel dashboard
5. **Review error logs** in Vercel Functions tab
